# Ships
There are N ships in the Mediterranean or Black Seas that move to one destination port. For objective reasons, they cannot enter a certain zone, which has a triangular shape.
If the ship's heading is such that after some time it crosses the forbidden zone, the captain should receive an alarm and urgently change course.
The geographic coordinates of a point on Earth are determined by latitude and longitude. Since the Mediterranean and Black Seas are located in the northeastern part of the Earth, therefore, by default, latitude is north and longitude is east.
